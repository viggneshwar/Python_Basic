Fundamentals of Python Programming:
###################################
Layman:
Python is universal/general purpose/high level or mid level programming language (not a boiler plate prog lang)
It falls under 2 major programming category - FBP (FUNC BASED PROG LANG) & OOPS (OBJ ORIENTED PROG LANG)

****************PYTHON PROGRAMMING STARTS HERE (2025-10-10/2025-10-18)******************************
Complexity:
###########
3 Types of programming levels are there -  Python (High & Mid)
High level - Complexity Lower, LOC - Line of Codes lesser

Mid level - Complexity Medium, LOC - Line of Codes (few lines)

Low level - Complexity Higher, LOC - Line of Codes higher (c/c++, Java) - boiler plate coding


How to become/understand/Use/Build(highlevel)  Programmers/Programs

Fear of Programming !!!
#################################################################################
1. Fear of Failure -
While I do programming, is it meaningful to have FOF? 
No, we are going to have better learning only...
More of failure leads to better success...

How can I overcome FOF? Failing Fast... will leads to faster success...

Different Mentality of us while learning programming-
1. I don't know programming, but i am ready to try learning it.. - Optimistic
2. I didn't get an oppurtunity to write programs, but I am willing to do - Optimistic
3. I don't know whether I can do programming - FOF -> Fail fast
4. I am not interested/can't do programming, because my mind is not programming mind - AI, Time, Effort we can overcome this...
To achieve all the above take out the FOF from your mindset...

Answer to get all above fixed -
TTT - Thirst, Trust, Thrust

2. Fear of Missing Out - FOMO - Take Competitive Advantage (Competition Leads to Success)
Why we have to learn a programming language like Python? To become an IT Professional
1. Automate our Tasks/manual activities
2. Atleast an IT engineer should know any one of the programming language for automation, 
help others (our kids/grand childs), 
to train our brain to think logically/functionally/automation/technical/analytically/reason out...
3. To perform any tasks like development, testing, automation, packaging, deployment, orchestration, scheduling.. etc.,
4. Some programming language which is universal known/used/improved state, we have choose that kind of programming language 
and need to known by everyone. - python
5. By learning a programming language, we can learn other programming language easily in a comparitive way

Why a data engineer/Data analyst/AI Engineer have to learn a programming language like python? As a Data Engineer/Data Analyst/Cloud Data Engineer (minimum the first point)
Why Python for us:
***1. To leverage an existing framework like Spark**/airflow/cloud functions/cloud composer/lambda (which developed years by 2000's of people)
**2. To develop custom functionalities/wrappers/reusable frameworks/generic frameworks/Tools... (MetricBot, DMA, DMF, DatAccura, Audit fw...)
*3. To build orchestration and scheduling using Airflow...
4. Use Python for data analysis/analytics/science/ml/ai/visualtion & creation of data pipelines (ETL/ELT), orchestration, scheduling..
5. We have extensive ecosystem of libraries & integration with lot of other frameworks is high - product building
6. To communicate with the other system(API) (Cloud functions)/databases/filesystems/AI systems.

Learning a Prog language like Python starts here....:
PDF - Installation & Pictorial representation of learning
notes - quick understanding or above and beyond understanding
***python module (IDE) - Help you build the end to end program as an application
CLI
Notebook Environment - Databricks NB env


Where can I develop a Python Program? In n number of environments (CLI/REPL, IDE, Batch script in Linux/Windows, Notebooks etc.,)
1. CLI/REPL - Command line interface / Read Evaluate Print Loop - For quick evaluation/execution/learning/testing of some code snippet

2. IDE - Integrated Development Environment - Help us create a full fledged application.
We have to understand, how to create a module in python.... so we can develop applications...

3. Notebooks - Offline/Online eg. Jupyter, Zeppelin, Google Colab, Databricks NB etc.,

How to run a Python Program?
cli -> write commands/programs and type enter to run it...
python nameof_python_program.py
IDE -> Run -> execute (ctrl + shift + f10)


What is a Python Programming Language?
High Level,
General Purpose/Universal,
Python is Interpreter Based,
Function Based and
Object Oriented Programming Language.

Python is a High Level Programming Language, how?
#without writing toomuch of lines of code, we can get the same result..
For eg.
import numpy
numpy.tan(1)#without writing tan function functionality, i just imported and used it at the high level

#difference between high and low level programming?
#low level programming example, by writing core logics
length=0
compname='INCEPTEZ TECHNOLOGIES'
for chr in compname:
   print(chr)
   length=length+1

print(length)

#high level programming -  with very few lines i achieved the expected result
compname='INCEPTEZ TECHNOLOGIES'
print(len(compname))

Python is a universal/general purpose programming language, how?
help('modules')#it show all common libraries used for filehandling, mail handling, compressions/encoding/decoding etc.,
import builtins
print(dir(builtins))

Python is Interpreter Based programming language?
What is an interpreter - If a programming language compiles the code line by line, then it is interpreter
What is an compiler    - If a programming language compiles the code completely  , then it is compiler

How a python program works:
reallife Layman example:
1. content will be read by eyes line by line 
2. eye will pass the given line to the brain
3. brain will convert this line into the native language
4. body is holding the brain and eyes..
5. finally native language converted line will be enriched with some additional features
6. processing/understanding the result

Python also does the same:
1. code will be read by interpreter(eyes) line by line 
2. interpreter will pass the given line to the compilter(brain)
3. compiler(brain) will convert this line into the bytecode eg. 010011 (native language)
4. Python Virtual Machine (Body) is holding the compiler(brain) and interpreter(eyes)..
5. Finally native language converted (bytecode) line additional libraries/parameter etc., (will be enriched with some additional features)
6. processing/understanding the result (will be done with the help of hardware like ram/cpu/hdd/network)

Indent based - Formatting, Structurizing, Beautifying for easy reading, understanding, reasoning etc.,
#SQL is an indend based programming language? False (Declarative programming model), though the indend is not correct, it works...
#Scala/Java/Linux shell scripting is an indend based programming language? False (Block programming model), though the indend is not correct, it works...


#Python is an indend based programming language? True, Only if the indend is correct the code will work, otherwise it fails... (most of python learners makes mistakes in indendation)


We can use tab Or 4 spaces for indending (approach/standard to use)
If we use 5 spaces/3 spaces across the block? it works
If we use space in one line 4 spaces and tab in another line within the same block? it will not work


If we use space in one line and tab in another line across the block of code?



Python is General Purpose/Universal (used across all the domains/platforms/systems like application dev, Analyticals, ML, DL, Gen AI, Visualization, DE, Middleware etc.,),
Opensource Prog language, Rich collection of libraries, Python is a strong legacy Prog language
import builtins
print(dir(builtins))
help('modules')
import pandas
import re,numpy
pandas.<type tab in ur keyboard)


High Level (simple, composable, built in, low LOCs)


**Python is an Interpreter based (insert values statement in hive)

Python is a Compiler or Interpreter Language? Interpreter based prog lang
Terminologies we are going to learn: Bytecode, Compiler, Interpreter, OS & VMs (linux/java/python)
Layman Example:
Hi Team
Good Morning
Let us learn Python programming starting with fundamentals...

Interpreter vs Compiler?
irfan compiled the below content
Hi Team -> interpreted
Good Morning -> interpreted
Let us learn Python programming starting with fundamentals... - interpreted

eyes - interpreter (python)/compiler (scala)
brain - compiler
foreign language -> eyes (interpret/compiled) -> brain (compile) -> mother tongue (bytecode/binarycode) -> virtual machine -> execution

Irfan did? Compilation
Aspirants did? Interpretation

#execution example of both
Interpreter Example:
vi python_interpreter.py
name='Inceptez'
age=11
print(name)
#print(something)
print(age)
print("hello")
print("good morning")

#Interpret the line by line of code and execute
python python_interpreter.py

vi scala_compiler.scala
object obj1 extends App
{
var name="Inceptez"
var age=11
println(name)
printlnxyz(age)
println("hello")
println("good morning")
println("thank u")
}

#Compile the complete code and execute
scalac scala_compiler.scala
scala obj1


Indent Based

#Python is an indend based programming, not a block based programming (achieve blocking using indendation itself) -
#It is must to do indentation (advantage - we need to do only 1 thing here, 1. Only Indendation, no blocking is need)

******Function Based Programming Language (FBP)
Allow us to use the existing functions directly or composing or we can create our own custom functions...


WHAT WE ARE GOING TO LEARN??
