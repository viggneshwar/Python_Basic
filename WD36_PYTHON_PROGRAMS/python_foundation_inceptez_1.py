print("A. Python is an indent based programming language")
#Why Python uses indend based programing ->
#1. Managing the program more efficiently
#2. Better Readablility of the code
#3. For creating the hierarchy of programming.
#4. By default 4 spaces we will give for indends, but more/less spaces or tabs also can be used...

#Indendation is needed for (hierarchy of programming),
# because we are doing block operation (lines of code) with in the for loop
team=['wd36','we47']
for i in team:
    print(f"hello {i} Team")
    print("thank you")

#Linux is not an intend based program, it is a block based rather:
'''
for i in `ls` 
do #starting a block
 echo "listing files in the folder"
    echo $i
echo "Thanks"
done #Ending the block
        echo "Completed"
'''

#indendation has to be uniform within the block of code (not mandatory across the block of code)
#below prog doesnt work if we are using different number of spaces between lines of code in a given block
for i in range(1,4):
    print("inside i")
    print(i)
    for  j in range(1,2):
      print("inside i")
      print(j)

#optimal number of spaces has to be 4, but any numbers you can give, dont use both tab & spaces

print("B. This is a commented line in Python")
# What is comment? Comment is a info/description/additional information for better understanding,
# which will not affect the program execution
# Usage of Comments: For descriptive purpose & for creating dead codes
#Comments are of 2 types:
# 1. Single line - #
# 2. Multi line or block comments - '''  '''
#print("hello is commented") #single line comment

#Triple quotes:
#Triple quotes can handle multiple quotes like single or double or any other characters

#Triple double quotes is used for muliline
#For handling paragraph/multilines text, we can use 3 single or doublequotes

#Assignment Operators (= or += or -=)- used to assign some values to a variable - return the value/reference as a result
age=43#here variable age is assigned with a value of 43
age+=1#here variable age is assigned with a value of 43+1 (value is operated with an arithmetic operator)
#or
age=age+1#here variable age is assigned with a value of 43+1 (value is operated with an arithmetic operator)
name=name.capitalize()#Here i am assigning the result of a function as a value to the name variable
i=int#i is a variable referring a program called int
#conclusion is an assignment operator can be used to assign a value or refer a program

#Arithmatic Operators (*/+- ** % ()) - will returns operated value as a result
#BODMAS rule (Precedence order -> Brackets, Orders (exponent/sqrt), Division or Mul, Add or  Sub
mul=5*10
div=10/2

sub=100-200

final_res=100+200/100-200#without using BODMAS
final_res=(100+200)/(100-200)#using BODMAS

power_val=2**4#2 to the power of 4 ie 16
mod_val=10%3 #Result is 1

#Relational operators (==, !=, >, <, <=, >=) - Used for comparing variables and values and returns boolean type as a result
print(5!=10)
print(5==10)
result:bool=5==10#We are assigning and comparing
print(result)
print(type(result))

#Logical Operators () - apply logic between multiple output of the relational operators and Returns boolean
#or - will check for the first occurance of true and return true
print("this will just print true once 1==1 is identified, it wont got to 3==4 check",1==1 or 3==4)

#Ternary - Short form of using the operators to achieve SIMPLE conditional/looping outputs in a
# single line short form
#Typical control (conditional) structure

I tried ,but i I had one doubt while executing the code ,
The code which i ran in CLI executed but it asked to install pandas  again in PyCharm — 
does this happen because PyCharm uses a separate virtual environment from the Python setup?
so for everytime do we need to install the new lib if we use new IDE (VENV)

######################All about While loop#######################################
#Characteristics of While Loop:
#While loop will run based on a condition
#While is a conditional looping - number of iterations are not known already, it varies based on the incremental value and the condition used
#We have to use while loop causiously, if we miss the condition, it will run infinately...
#Conditional looping (while loop) #not much important as like for loop
#While is an Entry controlled loop
#Example1:
sttime=7
endtime=9
while sttime<=endtime:#Signature of while loop requires a condition that returns boolean
   print(f"run the session every 30 mins upto {sttime}")
   sttime=sttime+.5

#Strategic2
#I wanted to rewrite/enrich the above program to engage the session only on weekdays or weekend?
#Using conditional structure and both looping construct in one program...
#Example2: Marrying unconditional & conditional looping with conditional structure (if condition)
lst_weekdays=['mon','tue','wed','thu','fri']
lst_weekends=['sat','sun']

endtimewe=14
batch_flag=input("pls let me know the batch id WD/WE")
if batch_flag=='WD':
    for days in lst_weekdays:
        sttime = 7
        print("running the session for day ",days)
        while sttime<=endtime:#Signature of while loop requires a condition that returns boolean
           print(f"check the session every 60 mins upto {sttime}")
           sttime=sttime+1
elif batch_flag=='WE':
    for days in lst_weekends:
        sttime = 9

        while sttime<=endtimewe:#Signature of while loop requires a condition that returns boolean
           print(f"check the session every 60 mins upto {sttime}")
           sttime=sttime+1

######################All about While loop#######################################

#Concept of Nested loops using for and while:
#Example1:
batches=['wd36','we47','ds22','devops1']
common_tools=['github','sql','python']
for batch in batches:
    print(f"for the batch {batch}")
    for tools in common_tools:
        print(f"tool {tools}")
        print(f"Batch {batch} is learning the tool {tools} ")

#Nested While loop:
#Example:I wanted to rewrite the for loop code using while loop by making it conditional, but more complex to handle.
daycnt=1
batch_flag=input("pls let me know the batch id WD/WE")

    while sttime<=endtime:
         print(f"check the session every 60 mins upto {sttime}")

    daycnt += 1
else:#since while is a conditional looping, it supports else also...
    print("no such batch")#Yes we can have else in while loop, because it is a conditional looping


#Usecase1: Try create tables for our kids from 2 to how many tables (get as an input)?
# Using while loop, lets create a table
# Using simple or nested for loop, skip the 5 and 10 tables
#Table has to created upto 12 numbers
tot_tables=5
for i in range(2,tot_tables+1):
    for j in range(1,11):
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i*j}")

#Additional usecase: Try to enrich the above program with dynamically getting the input from the user to control
#starting table, maximum table output and total number of tables

#For Loop with Break and Continue constructs/clauses:
#Break is used to break the execution of the loop by come out of the loop if a given condition matches
#Continue is used to skip the given iteration of the loop (and execute the next iteration) if a given condition matches
allteam=['DEV','TEST','SECURITY','HR','SYSADMIN']

        print("should not take wfh",teams)
        #continue#continue to the next item in the list, skipping the current item
    print("you can take wfh", teams)

#Usecase: Write a program to apply tax 10% for all the states, other than pondy and goa
states_lst=['tn','po','ke','ka','go']
product_price=15000

#break construct usage : Eg. give only bonus to employees who is getting salary <15000

#What is a collection type? Semi structured data
#Collection is a datatype which is going to help us collect different data items/values in a collection format
#It leads to the next dimensions of data
#it is flexible, dynamic, performant, complex, occupies less space in the storage and network transfer of data

#list, dictionary, tuple, set

#Simple Examples of Collection Types:
#list []: collection of similar items
#indexed sequenced collection of homogeneous/similar elements/items - eg. column
#                            0          1           2       3
name_of_aspirants:list[str]=['nivetha','prathap','dinesh','poongothai']
#name_of_aspirants:list[str]=[30,'chennai','prathap','dinesh','poongothai'] #works but dont prefer

#dictionary {k1:v1,k2:v2} eg. key column and value(s) column: collection of key and value pair, key is unique and key is of similar type and value can be of other similar
dict1={"id": 1,"first": "Harshitha","last": "devi"}

#tuple (): Indexed sequenced Collection of hetrogeneous elements/items - eg. row
address_of_aspirants: tuple[int, str, str, str, int]=(139,'5th main road','velachery','chennai',600042)

#set {values} : collection of unique values, eligible for performing set operations...
phone_number_aspirants:set={9840800131,9840800221,9840800131}

#Example of all collection types used:
#{'process': 'ETL Process1', 'source': {'hive', 'Bigquery'}, 'target': ['HDFS', 'GCS'], 'cols': ['custid', 'upper(custname) as upper_custname'], 'tablename': 'customer', 'where': "(city='chennai')", 'uris': ('gcs://abc/xyz_bucket/', 100)}

#Different types of collection types? in the order of importance
#list, dict, tuple, set

#Why we need collection types?
#To manage/store/parse the complex dataset in a hirarchical/nested/complex structure stored or to process semi structure data, nested data,
# dynamic schema-ful data (avro), variable data/metadata, for a data or metadata/configuration driven approaches..

#Different characteristics of collection types? we are going to learn in detail below..
#Iterable (looping), mutable (changable) - updatable (modifyable) & resizable (added/removed), accessible (select using index, position, value, key)

######What are the topics we have to learn in collection types#######
#Iterable? Yes, all collection types are iterable in python.
